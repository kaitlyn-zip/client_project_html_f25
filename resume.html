      <h2>Craft a Resume that Tells Your Story</h2>
      <p>
        Your resume is often your first impression—an opportunity to highlight your unique strengths, skills, and
        experiences to potential employers. Whether you’re starting from scratch or looking to polish an existing
        resume, these resources are here to help you every step of the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        UMSI students are in high demand, and a clear, well-organized resume will help you stand out among applicants.
        On this page, you'll find practical tips, templates, and guides—all tailored to the needs of School of
        Information students and aligned with employer expectations.

      <h2>Resume Writing Made Easy: Steps to Success</h2>
      <ol>
        <li><strong>Download a UMSI-Approved Template:</strong> Start with a format that works—no need to design from
          scratch.</li>
        <li><strong>Gather Your Experiences:</strong> List jobs, internships, volunteer roles, coursework, and projects
          most relevant to your goals.</li>
        <li><strong>Write Impactful Bullets:</strong> Use action verbs and highlight your skills, results, and unique
          contributions.</li>
        <li><strong>Tailor for Each Opportunity:</strong> Customize your resume for every job or internship you pursue.
        </li>
        <li><strong>Review and Edit:</strong> Proofread for errors, check formatting, and ask for feedback from peers or
          a career coach.</li>
      </ol>
      <p><b>Pro Tip:</b> Don’t overlook the power of keywords. Many employers use applicant tracking systems (ATS) to scan resumes before a human even sees them. Review the job description carefully and integrate the same language—especially skills, tools, and role-specific terms—into your resume. This not only improves your chances of passing the initial screen but also shows that you’ve paid close attention to the employer’s priorities. Pair this with a clean, consistent format and you’ll make it easier for both software and humans to recognize your fit.</p>

      <h2>Resume FAQ</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>How long should my resume be?</strong><br>
          For most UMSI students and new grads, one page is best. More experienced professionals may require two pages.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Do I need a different resume for each application?</strong><br>
          It’s wise to tailor your resume to the requirements and keywords of each opportunity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Is it okay to include coursework or student projects?</strong><br>
          Absolutely! UMSI coursework and projects are valued by employers, especially if they show relevant skills and
          impact.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>How often should I update my resume?</strong><br>
          Update your resume every semester, after major projects, or whenever you gain a new role or responsibility.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>What if I don’t have much work experience?</strong><br>
          Emphasize transferable skills from volunteer work, leadership roles, clubs, and academic projects. Show how you’ve applied your abilities in real-world or team settings.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Do employers really care about GPA?</strong><br>
          Include your GPA if it’s strong (generally 3.5 or higher) and relevant for early-career roles or internships. For experienced professionals, GPA becomes less important over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p><b>UMSI Tip:</b> Employers value the unique mix of skills UMSI students bring. Don’t hesitate to highlight methods from your coursework—such as usability testing, contextual inquiry, survey design, information visualization, or Python/SQL data analysis. Projects from classes like SI 582 (Interaction Design) or SI 649 (Information Visualization) often demonstrate direct, job-ready skills. If you’ve worked on a client-based capstone or multidisciplinary project, make sure to frame it like professional experience: who the stakeholders were, what methods you used, and what impact your work had. These academic experiences carry weight and often make UMSI students stand out.</p>
