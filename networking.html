            <h2>Why Networking Matters</h2>
            <p>
                Networking is one of the most powerful tools in your career development journey. Studies show that more
                than 70% of jobs are found through networking rather than through cold applications. Employers value
                connections and referrals because they often highlight candidates who are already trusted by someone
                within their network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beyond landing a job, networking opens doors to valuable opportunities. Through conversations with
                peers, alumni, and industry professionals, you can gain insider knowledge, discover trends, and uncover
                roles you may not have even known existed. It‚Äôs also a chance to meet mentors who can guide your career
                path and share lessons from their own experiences.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most importantly, networking is not about collecting as many contacts as possible. Instead, it‚Äôs about
                cultivating genuine, mutual relationships that grow over time. When you approach networking with
                curiosity, respect, and authenticity, you‚Äôll build connections that last far beyond a single event or
                job search.
